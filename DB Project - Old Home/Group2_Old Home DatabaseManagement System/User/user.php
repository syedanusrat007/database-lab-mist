<h1>Welcome to Old Home Database Management System</h1>
<div style="padding:20px; margin-top:30px; font-size:25px; font-family:Alegreya Sans Regular; text-align:left;">
<p>In traditional agro-based societies, older people live with their near and dear ones and in most of the cases dependent on them in meeting their needs. Socially it is the responsibility of the children to take care of their older parents when the elderly people are unable to meet up their demands with own efforts. But it is quite difficult task for our young generation to perform their traditional responsibility towards their parents in modern industrialized world due to their job and professional duty. </p>
<p>In the advent of industrialization and urbanization a lot of changes have been taken place in the world. Modernization has affected our agro-based society and increased the migration from rural to urban and country to country affecting the pull factors and push factors. Older parents in Bangladesh are sending their children abroad for study job and even for settlement. Some young and adult children are leaving their older parents behind. That is how the idea of "Old Home" came.</p>
<p>In Apon Nibash Old Home, we take care of elderly people and provide home for them. This "Old Home Database Management System" is designed to help any "Old Home" to store any kind of data so that we can access it easily. Thus our Old Home runs efficiently with the help of modern technology.</p>
